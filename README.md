### 👨💻 Who Am I?

Ever since I wrote my first line of code, I’ve been fascinated by the power of technology to shape lives and solve problems. Raised on curiosity and driven by innovation, I blend engineering with creativity—crafting seamless applications that don’t just work, but delight.

### 🚀 My Story So Far

- **Learning @ NIT Jaipur:** I’m earning my B.Tech, but more importantly, I’m learning to think like a builder and creator.
- **Full Stack in Action:** From architecting backends to polishing pixel-perfect UIs, I make ideas come alive—fast and reliable.
- **UI/UX Obsession:** Great software is invisible when it’s designed right. I focus on intuitive, friendly interfaces.
- **Rooted in Real-World Impact:** Every project I take on aims to bring tangible value, whether it’s boosting startups or streamlining tedious processes.
- **Debugger at Heart:** Debugging, testing, and swift bug-fixing aren’t just skills, they’re second nature in my workflow.
